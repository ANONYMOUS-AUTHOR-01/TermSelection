* Locality modularization can be generated by running Locality_modularization\src\modularization\moduleTest.java
* Uniform interpolant (UI) can be generated by running UI_modularization\src\forgetting\Forgetting.java
* The compactness test of locality modularization and UI is in Locality_modularization\src\modularization\moduleEvaluation.java
* Evaluation results and test signatures are in test_terms
